In this folder are the figures generated by the autoencoder. One is generated and saved each time the code runs. If I find any significant or important, I may put them in their own subfolder with a txt file as commentary.

The figures represent a single batch (256 images) from the test set. On the left of each rectangle is the original image, in the center is a visualization of the latent space resulting from the input image, and on the right is the autoencoder's reconstruction. The batch is randomly selected each time so it will never be the same.
